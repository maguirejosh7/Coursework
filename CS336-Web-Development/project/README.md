Over the years, the number of students involved in the student blood drive has been declining. There needs to be a more effective way to attract student donors to the blood drive. Our web application with its simple user interface allows for easy registration for the blood drive as well as an interactive graphic to help attract more donors. As a student signs up to donate blood, a graphic will dynamically change, hoping to entice more students to want to donate blood.

There will be a database on the back-end to store each time slot for signups. The web application will show all time slots, highlighting the specific spots that have been reserved. An admin will have the ability to add days and slots for future blood drives. The front-end will use React and Node.js to implement the interactive graphic as a student signs up. The graphic will show a large human heart, although not filled in. As a student signs up to donate blood, they will be brought to a new page, which will show the heart a bit more filled in. As more students sign up, the heart will fill until a goal is reached. The state of this heart will be stored on the server.
