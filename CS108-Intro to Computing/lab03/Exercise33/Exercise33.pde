//Exercise 3.3

//a
println("-------------------a-------------");
//gives counter1 a 1 and counter2 a 2 (1 + counter1)
int counter1 = 1, counter2 = counter1 + 1;
println(counter1);
println(counter2);
//we were correct

//b
println("-------------------b-------------");
//it is going to create it and print it but it might give
//us an error because there is no number in the "box"
//int aValue;
//println(aValue);
//we were correct!

//c
println("-------------------c-------------");
//we can't fool it it already knows what Pi is- a constant
//it should give us an error
//println(PI=3.0);
//we were right AGAIN.

//d
println("-------------------d------------");
//this will create 2 of the same variables and give us an error
//float anotherValue, anotherValue;
//correctamundo.

//e
println("-------------------e-------------");

//i.
float b = 0.0;
float a = 2*PI;
b = sin(a);
println (b);

//ii
println(log(1000.0));

//iii
println( pow(10.0,3.0));

//iiii
println(ceil(9.1));
