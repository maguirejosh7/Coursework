I'm going to make an arcade spaceship game with enemies that come in waves. At the end of each wave you can upgrade your ship and the enemies come
in bigger quantities. They also get weapon upgrades. The upgrade menu will have lots of buttons for upgrading the ship.
The background will look like its moving but it will just be *stars* that are moving down the screen.
