-----------------------------
This project includes the files:
index.php
wordcounter.php
WordItem.php
Dvorak.php
--------------------------------



------------how it works--------------------
index.php is the homepage. From there you can enter text into the text area and:
1. Count!: parses through user input and retrieves the number of words and their frequency. COMMENT OUT LINE 46 IN wordcounter.php FOR CASE SENSITIVITY!!
2. Dvorak!:Convert accidential Qwerty into real Dvorak**
3. Theres room for more! Time and motivation permitting, I could add more to the wordcounter.php file to get more info about the words I typed in. Some sort of word highlighting tool would be nice too. Adding additional word functions would be easy using php's thousands of built in operations and functions.

**This is confusing. I use a qwerty keyboard layout in windows, but use a dvorak layout keyboard on my desk. With a autohotkey script, I am able to switch between qwerty and dvorak by pushing Scroll Lock. This allows me to use shortcuts like Control-Z, Control-C.... Sometimes I forget to turn it on and don't realize it for a while. This produces jumbled letters (Q in qwerty is " in dvorak). This button converts it from jumbled dvorak.

Bugs: none documented.

------------------------------
Much of my code was inspired by:
-www.php.net and their manual of the thousands of different build in -functions and what not.
-stackoverflow.com
-www.w3schools.com/php with its wonderful examples and tutorials.
-lets not forget google...
-God, the ultimate programmer

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TESTING~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This text can be used to test the Qwerty to Dvorak button:
kjd xfgiv yos,l ysb cfmr; s.do kjd pa/t hsue*************KJD XFGIV NOS<L YSB CFMR: S>DO KJD PA?T HSUe
...........
Test the word counter out using a seperate word counter such as in a document writer or online (http://www.wordcounter.net is a good one).
You can also use this paragraph, the opening to a short story of mine:
(Open Office and wordcounter.org both count 197 words) 

----------------------------------------------
	One lovely Saturday morning in Lillyville, Tom walked outside to get the mail at the end of his driveway. He stopped here and there along the way to admire his perfect flowerbeds. Half way back and Tom was already half way through his second cup of black morning coffee and shaking his head in dismay at the news paper. “Herm, mmm, some people” he murmured.
	Tom had almost reached his front porch when he thought he heard in the distance a low rumble. He glanced over his shoulder expecting to see the lifted mud-splattered truck belonging to the redneck baffoons down the street. “CRUNCH!” Tom's right big toe made a harsh ugly sound as it collided with the not so recently painted edge of the front porch step. “GEEZE!!!” Tom yipped as his eyebrows skyrocketed. His piping hot coffee flung up into the air in front of him and spattered down onto his reading material before drizzling down his pants and onto the smooth stone path, lubricating it just enough to send his left foot spiraling out from under him. Shortly thereafter, Tom's receding hairline came crashing down onto the musty old wood of his front porch.
