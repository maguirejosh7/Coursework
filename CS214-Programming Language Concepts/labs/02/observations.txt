Observations:

Example 1: 
-Line 738 in lex.yy.c yeilds a switch statement, where cases 1 and 2 both link to line numbers 6 and 7 in example1.lex (the start and stop commands).

Example2:
-Feeding proper inputs yields expected results.
-Feeding it a number then letter (7G) spits out NUMBER WORD.
-Underscore "_" echos result, as well as any other special character.

-with improved code, underscore counts as a word "_1" or "_x_X_X_" or "_". 
-"7_" spits out NUMBER WORD. 

Example3
-reading in from StudentInfo.h spits out every catagory of symbol it runs into. Starts out: KEYWORD:class, IDENTIFIER: StudentInfo, PUNCTUATION: {...

Example 4
A non-terminal  doesn't need to use use bison to recieve input as tokens (translated from input text to tokens by flex).  Terminals do. 

Runs as it should, but when you type in random things, it echos them except it sticks the echo in your current typing box and can't be backspaced. (Did I miss something obvious?)

Example 5
Works as it should.. "heat turned on... temperature set to 212".

Example 6
