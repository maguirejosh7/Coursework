We the undersigned affirm that (i) the attached project is the work of ourselves 
and no one else, and (ii) the "fair share percentage" accurately reflects 
the percentage of a fair share that each person contributed to the project. 
(If each person did their fair share, use 100%.) 

**Emailed Professor Norman about our case. He did his share plus the part we were supposed to do together, I finished my share April 7, wasn't able to find anyone to borrow code from for the path part so am just turning in the CommandLine section.
