In the future, in every file that starts like this...

/* Filename
 * Student Name:
 * Date:
 * Begun by: Joel Adams, for CS 112 at Calvin College.
 */

...please be sure to fill the Student Name and Date fields out. 
I won't deduct for it this time, but in the future I will, so be careful.

That said, everything else looks good and runs well.  Nice work!

Score: 100/100
