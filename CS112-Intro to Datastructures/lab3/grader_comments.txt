-15	Submitted a Windows executable
-3	testSetSize (appears to) fail

It's okay to work on your projects in a Windows environment, but the final submission must be compiled in Linux.
Otherwise, I can't run it or grade it, and I can't give you full points.

Most of the code looks good except for the SetSize method, but I can't give any definite feedback, as I can't run the program.
Best of luck on future projects.

Score: 82/100
